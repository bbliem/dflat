%% an argument x defeats an argument y if x attacks y
defeat(X,Y) :- att(X,Y),
               not vaf.

%% Guess a set S \subseteq A
in(X) :- not out(X), arg(X).
out(X) :- not in(X), arg(X).

%% S has to be conflict-free
:- in(X), in(Y), defeat(X,Y).

%% The argument x is defeated by the set S
defeated(X) :- in(Y), defeat(Y,X).

%% S defeats all arguments which do not belong to S
:- out(X), not defeated(X).
